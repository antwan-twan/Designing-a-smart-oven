# Designing a (part of) a Smart Oven with ESP8266
Today, I'm designing a piece of a concept I came up with for a project for school. 

Its a smart oven connected via IoT. 

I'll be making a tiny part of the interface using a Servo-motor and an ESP8266 board (also known as NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)). 

## 1. Setup
For this experiment, you'll need a:
- Computer with Arduino IDE installed
- An Adafruit IO account
- An ESP8266 board
- A Servo-motor

and maybe some cables to connect your Servo to the board. Although this depends on what kind a connector you have on your Servo.

### Adafruit IO Setup
First of all create an account on [Adafruit IO](io.adafruit.com).
Afterwards, go to your Account settings and retrieve your key.
